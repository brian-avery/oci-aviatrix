# oci-quickstart-aviatrix

These are Terraform modules that deploys [Aviatrix](https://docs.aviatrix.com/StartUpGuides/oracle-aviatrix-cloud-controller-startup-guide.html) on [Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI)]((https://cloud.oracle.com/en_US/cloud-infrastructure)). It is developed jointly by Oracle and Aviatrix.

This repo is under active development. Building open source software is a community effort. We're excited to engage with the community building this.

The Aviatrix cloud network solution consists of two components, the controller and gateways, both of which are cloud VMs. Gateways are launched from the controller console to specific VCNs.

## Aviatrix Controller

Detailed instructions for deploying Aviatrix Controller on OCI can be found in the [Controller](./controller/README.md) space.
